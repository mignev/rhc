    description <<-DESC
      By default CloudStrap applications prepare, distribute, and activate deployments
      on every git push. Alternatively, a user may choose to disable automatic
      deployments and use 'app deploy' and 'app deployment' commands to fully control the
      deployment lifecycle.

      Use this command to prepare, distribute and deploy manually from a git reference
      (commit id, tag or branch) or from a binary file. Check also 'app configure-app'
      to configure your application to deploy manually and set the number of deployments
      to keep in history.
