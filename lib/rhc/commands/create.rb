    summary "Create an application"
    description <<-DESC
      Create an application. Every CloudStrap application must have one
      web cartridge which serves web requests, and can have a number of
      other cartridges which provide capabilities like databases,
      scheduled jobs, or continuous integration.

      You can see a list of all valid cartridge types by running
      'app cartridge list'. CloudStrap also supports downloading cartridges -
      pass a URL in place of the cartridge name and we'll download
      and install that cartridge into your app.  Keep in mind that
      these cartridges receive no security updates.  Note that not
      all CloudStrap servers allow downloaded cartridges.

      When your application is created, a URL combining the name of
      your app and the name of your domain will be registered in DNS.
      A copy of the code for your application will be checked out locally
      into a folder with the same name as your application.  Note that
      different types of applications may require different folder
      structures - check the README provided with the cartridge if
      you have questions.

      CloudStrap runs the components of your application on small virtual
      servers called "gears".  Each account or plan is limited to a number
      of gears which you can use across multiple applications.  Some
      accounts or plans provide access to gears with more memory or more
      CPU.  Run 'app account' to see the number and sizes of gears available
      to you.  When creating an application the --gear-size parameter
      may be specified to change the gears used.
